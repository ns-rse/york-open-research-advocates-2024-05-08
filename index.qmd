## Background

+ Genetic Epidemiologist 2000-2008
+ Cancer Registry Statistician 2008-2009
+ Medical Statistician (Clinical Trials) 2009-2018
+ Data Scientist 2018-2022
+ Research Software Engineer 2022-Present

Good afternoon, my name is Neil Shephard and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Sheffield.

I've not always been a Research Software Engineer though, and have had a varied career spending time as a Genetic
Epidemiologist in Manchester, Perth Australia and back in Sheffield, then working at a Cancer Registry before nine years
as a Medical Statistician in Clinical Trials and a stint as a Data Scientist before ending up here.

What relevance does my career have? Well early on in my first job I discovered literate programming a method of writing
code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and realised that there is a different way of working from
the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets.

Not only was it more efficient, but it also meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which
engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.


Now that I've explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I'm going to tell you a bit about how
I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield.

So I've had a long standing interest in open and reproducible research and have taken this extrapolated path to become a
Research Software Engineer. The Research Software Engineering team and associated groups in the University such as IT
Research Services and the Library have a small community, we interact regularly on various aspects of service provision
and there is a Slack channel. There is an Open Research group in the Library, with specialisation in licensing, data
management and so forth and an Open Research Manager, my colleague Dr Jenni Adams. There is an Open Research Working
Group of

Just over two years ago I was tasked with growing the RSE community to improve engagement and members who interacted across
the University.

## INOSC Incubator Programme

::: {.notes}
I was browsing through media feeds as I do came across the OSC Incubator Programme which was running in early
March 2022 and was advertised as a way of growing your community and I thought this would be a useful way of finding out
some ways to help grow the RSE community at The University of Sheffield.

I can be a bit slow at times and didn't think too much about the key word in the title "Incubator" but signed up.

In the very first session the penny dropped and I realised that I would be establishing an Open Science Community in
Sheffield, which is where the "accidental" part of this short presentation comes from.

So what did I let myself in for? Well thankfully it's a really well structured course!

The International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within
the Netherlands with 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands who collectively form a
national network of communities.

The Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands and runs over 14 weeks and takes people through setting up a local OSC Community.

## OSC Incubator Programme - Curriculum

<!-- :::: {.columns} -->

1. Mission and Vision

3. Community Engagement

4. Stakeholder Engagement
5. Monitoring and Sustainability
6. Open Session and Final Presentation
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- :::: -->

::: {.notes}
This involves setting a Mission and Vision, how to go about Community Engagement and Recruiting Members, engaging with
Stakeholders, monitoring activity, progress and sustainability.

The OSC Incubator Programme spent a session on each, typically three hours once a fortnight on each of these topics with
interactive sessions and break-out groups as well as homework to go off and develop each area and come up with detailed
plans for each. I'd like to say I completed all of these in great detail but in reality because this was something I was
fitting in around my work the result is a bit patchy.  However, with the brilliant support and encouragement from Jenni
Adams and a few others I've forged ahead and the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield now exists.

The Incubator Programme is structured in such a manner as to guide you in the development of a plan for
the community which in essence can serve as a basis for grant applications.

I'm not going to go into the various areas in detail but will cover why communities are important, the mission and
vision, member recruitment and community engagement.

## Why Communities

![[Improving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years](https://www.cos.io/blog/cos-celebrates-10-years)](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model2.png){width=75%}

:::{.notes}
Being somewhat naive about the role communities play it was useful to find out how they fit in to effecting culture
change and I really like this graphic from a paper by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Open Science Framework,
which I think explains the role communities play well.

Infrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the
Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point
to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.

But for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many
popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible.

From the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do
within the system to gain recognition which in turn defines the incentives that reward participants for participating in
the system.

Whilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is
to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of
supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others
using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is
possible.

Thus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research
practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines
develop and mature over time.

:::{.notes}
Various events are already organised that help bring people together to talk about and share ideas around Open Research
practices.

There are the Open Research Conversations, the RSE team have run regular Lunchbyte sessions which cover technical
aspects of conducting research using programming tools and making software FAIR.

Last year saw the return of the successful Sheffield OpenFest which showcased and championed Open Research
activities and the summer saw a series Faculty of Seminars on making data FAIR, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable.

This semester there has seen the first in a series of seminars on How to Share Survey Data led by Ric Campbell and the
first in the series was __How to Share Survey Data_.

With the support of my colleagues we have re-launched the Sheffield R User group and had regularish monthly meetings
since October 2023. These are events where people present their work with using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
statistical programming language which I like as I'm quite a practical person who likes helping people solve their
problems with code.

With Jim Uttley and Zuzanna Zagrodzka's who ran it previously we are also re-launching the
[ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) Journal Club which aims to discuss diverse issues, papers and ideas
about improving science, reproducibility and the Open Science movement and the first of those is scheduled for next week
following the next Open Research Conversation. We'll be meeting in the Diamond next week to discuss a paper on
reproducibility in the psychological sciences and if you follow the links you can find out more about paper that will be
presented and how to attend either in person or online.
