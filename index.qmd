Thank you Ben,

Good afternoon, my name is Neil Shephard and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Sheffield.

## Background

+ Genetic Epidemiologist 2000-2008
+ Cancer Registry Statistician 2008-2009
+ Medical Statistician (Clinical Trials) 2009-2018
+ Data Scientist 2018-2022
+ Research Software Engineer 2022-Present

::: {.notes}
I've not always been a Research Software Engineer though, and have had a varied career spending time as a Genetic
Epidemiologist in Manchester, Perth Australia and back in Sheffield, then working at a Cancer Registry before nine years
as a Medical Statistician in Clinical Trials and a stint as a Data Scientist before ending up here.

What relevance does my career have? Well early on in my first job I tired very quickly of copying figures into documents
and retyping numbers into tables and discovered literate programming in R using Sweave, which gave me a method of writing
code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and realised that there is a different way of working from
the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets.

Not only was it more efficient, but when working in Clinical Trials I discovered how to version control my code and
share it on forges such as GitHub and GitLab it meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which
engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.


Now that I've explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I'm going to tell you a bit about how
I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield.

So I've had a long standing interest in open and reproducible research and have taken this extrapolated path to become a
Research Software Engineer. The Research Software Engineering team and associated groups in the University such as
Research IT and Support and Library Services, we interact regularly on various aspects of service provision
and there is a Slack channel. There is an Open Research group in the Library, with specialisation in licensing, data
management and so forth and an Open Research Manager, my colleague Dr Jenni Adams. There is an Open Research Working
Group of

Just over two years ago I was tasked with growing the RSE community to improve engagement between members who interacted
across the University and expand participation.

## INOSC Incubator Programme

::: {.notes}
Whilst browsing around on media feeds I came across the OSC Incubator Programme which was running in early
March 2022 and was advertised as a way of growing your community and I thought this would be a useful way of finding out
some ways to help grow the RSE community at The University of Sheffield so signed up.

I can be a bit slow at times and didn't think too much about the key word in the title "Incubator".

In the very first session the penny dropped and I realised that I would be establishing an Open Science Community in
Sheffield, which is where the "accidental" part of this short talks title comes from.

So what did I let myself in for? Well thankfully it's a really well structured course!

The International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within
to 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands who collectively form a national network.

The Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands. It runs over 14 weeks with a three
hour morning session every other week and homework tasks in-between and takes people through a series of steps to help
them establish a local OSC Community.

## Why Communities?

:::{.notes}
Before I go through the curriculum I thought it would be worth explaining why there is a focus on communities and how
they fit in to effecting culture change as I was somewhat naive about this.

I think this graphic from a paper by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Open Science Framework, helps explains
the role communities play well.

Infrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the
Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point
to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.

But for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many
popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible and interoperable and provide
training.

From the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do
within the system to gain recognition and reward participants for participating in the system and adopting the policy
changes.

Whilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is
to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of
supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others
using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research
is possible.

Thus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research
practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines
develop and mature over time.

## Normalising Behaviour

![Diffusion of Innovation](img/diffusion_innovation.png)


::: {.notes}
This graphic shows the Diffusion of Innovation, on the x-axis you have the propensity to adopt new practices, with high
on the far left and low, or high resistance on the far right. You have a small number of innovators on the far left,
followed by some early adopters, they are followed by the Early Majority and then you start reaching those who somewhat
resist change, the Late Majority and at the far end you have those who really don't want to change who might be
considered Laggards.

Ok so that hopefully explains why communities are important and the role they can play in effecting change.

How does the OSC Incubator Programme help with community formation and direction?

As mentioned they have three hour sessions once a fortnight and we started by understanding and crafting a mission and
vision statement which sets out what the community seeks to achieve.

There is then a session where you think about how to engage with the community and recruit members followed by a
sessions on engaging with stakeholders such as Universities and funders, how to monitor activity, progress and the
longer term sustainability of the community.

The Incubator Programme is structured in such a manner as to guide you in the development of a plan for
the community which in essence can serve as a basis for grant applications.

I'd like to say I completed all of these in great detail but in reality because this was something I was
fitting in around my work the result is a bit patchy.  However, with the brilliant support and encouragement from Jenni
Adams, the Open Research Manager at the Library and a few others I've forged ahead and the Open Scholarship Community
Sheffield now exists.


The programme I attended had a diverse group of people from France, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Finland and the UK
(Durham as well as myself) and I've kept in contact with some of those who undertook the course and are still actively
working on their communities.

So what has changed since starting OSC Sheffiled?

Well I'm quite fortuante in that there is already a strong shift towards Open Research here at Sheffield and there are
already various events organised that help bring people together to talk about and share ideas around Open Research
practices.

There are the Open Research Conversations which are monthly seminars organised by my colleague Jenni to discuss
different topics around Open Research, publishing, data access and so forth. Jenni also organises the successful
OpenFest which is returning for its third season in eptember

, the RSE team have run regular Lunchbyte sessions which cover technical
aspects of conducting research using programming tools and making software FAIR.

Last year saw the return of the successful Sheffield OpenFest which showcased and championed Open Research
activities and the summer saw a series Faculty of Seminars on making data FAIR, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable.

This semester there has seen the first in a series of seminars on How to Share Survey Data led by Ric Campbell and the
first in the series was __How to Share Survey Data_.

With the support of my colleagues we have re-launched the Sheffield R User group and had regularish monthly meetings
since October 2023. These are events where people present their work using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
statistical programming language which I like as I'm quite a practical person who likes helping people solve their
problems with code.

With Jim Uttley and Zuzanna Zagrodzka's who ran it previously we have also re-launched the
[ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) Journal Club which aims to discuss diverse issues, papers and ideas
about improving science, reproducibility and the Open Science movement and these have seen moderate attendance since
they started in January this year.

Just as with the Open Research Conversations these are hybrid events and anyone is welcome to attend.

:::{.notes}
As well as resurrecting SheffieldR and ReproducibiliTea Journal Club since establishing OSC Sheffield I've had some
involvement with the wider OSC community. The OSC International has an annual meeting which as representative I attended
which is primarily concerned with governance of the OSC.

I helped out with this years Incubator Programme and attended the session where existing representatives or members
spoke with the current in take and prior to that Sam Nesbit from the University of Sussex had reached out to myself and
Jenni to have a chat in much the same way as Ben has invited me here today to talk about my experience so far.

I also thought it might be worth mentioning some of the challenges I think there are.

The first and perhaps biggest challenge I've found has been local engagement, there are a a bunch of people
in Sheffield who are interested and motivated to see open research and reproducibility be adopted more widely but they
are already engaged in doing so themselves (the early adopters and early majority) and its the people who are aren't
already aware of the movement and the late majority and laggards who are really the ones I think would benefit from
seeing the practices and behaviours normalised but that takes time.

Beyond Sheffield there is the challenge of banding together with other OSCs within the UK to form a wider national
network and perhaps concerns with how OSC compares and fits in with the UK Research Network but I think there is space
for both as they have common goals but from different angles, with UKRN promoting training and disseminating best
practices and understand what factors promote reproducibility and replicability. Communities compliment these efforts
and should provide local support for when people come across problems that weren't covered in training or are unique to
a persons problem.

From a personal perspective, whilst the University of Sheffield has been supportive of the idea of OSC Sheffield they
haven't afforded me any work time allocation to cover the time I spend on it so the tasks of coordinating SheffieldR and
Reproducibilitea and so forth are an adjunct to my main duties and responsibilities, but as I said at the outset I'm
passionate about open and reproducible research so I don't mind.
