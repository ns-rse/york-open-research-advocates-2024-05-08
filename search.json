Well early on in my first job I tired very quickly of copying figures into documents and retyping numbers into tables and discovered literate programming in R using Sweave, which gave me a method of writing code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and realised that there is a different way of working from the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets.\nNot only was it more efficient, but when working in Clinical Trials I discovered how to version control my code and share it on forges such as GitHub and GitLab it meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.\nNow that I’ve explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I’m going to tell you a bit about how I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield."

Well thankfully it’s a really well structured course!\nThe International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within to 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands who collectively form a national network.\nThe Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands. It runs over 14 weeks with a three hour morning session every other week and homework tasks in-between and takes people through a series of steps to help them establish a local OSC Community."

    "text": "Why Communities?\n\n\n\nImproving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years\n\n\n\n\nBefore I go through the curriculum I thought it would be worth explaining why there is a focus on communities and how they fit in to effecting culture change as I was somewhat naive about this.\nI think this graphic from a paper by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Open Science Framework, helps explains the role communities play well.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.\nBut for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible and interoperable and provide training.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do within the system to gain recognition and reward participants for participating in the system and adopting the policy changes.\nWhilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is possible.\nThus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines develop and mature over time.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

You have a small number of innovators on the far left, followed by some early adopters, they are followed by the Early Majority and then you start reaching those who somewhat resist change, the Late Majority and at the far end you have those who really don’t want to change who might be considered Laggards."

However, with the brilliant support and encouragement from Jenni Adams, the Open Research Manager at the Library and a few others I’ve forged ahead and the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield now exists.\nThe programme I attended had a diverse group of people from France, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Finland and the UK (Durham as well as myself) and I’ve kept in contact with some of those who undertook the course and are still actively working on their communities."

Jenni also organises the successful OpenFest which is returning for its third season in eptember\n, the RSE team have run regular Lunchbyte sessions which cover technical aspects of conducting research using programming tools and making software FAIR.\nLast year saw the return of the successful Sheffield OpenFest which showcased and championed Open Research activities and the summer saw a series Faculty of Seminars on making data FAIR, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\nThis semester there has seen the first in a series of seminars on How to Share Survey Data led by Ric Campbell and the first in the series was __How to Share Survey Data_."

The OSC International has an annual meeting which as representative I attended which is primarily concerned with governance of the OSC.\nI helped out with this years Incubator Programme and attended the session where existing representatives or members spoke with the current in take and prior to that Sam Nesbit from the University of Sussex had reached out to myself and Jenni to have a chat in much the same way as Ben has invited me here today to talk about my experience so far.\nI also thought it might be worth mentioning some of the challenges I think there are.\nThe first and perhaps biggest challenge I’ve found has been local engagement, there are a a bunch of people in Sheffield who are interested and motivated to see open research and reproducibility be adopted more widely but they are already engaged in doing so themselves (the early adopters and early majority) and its the people who are aren’t already aware of the movement and the late majority and laggards who are really the ones I think would benefit from seeing the practices and behaviours normalised but that takes time.\nBeyond Sheffield there is the challenge of banding together with other OSCs within the UK to form a wider national network and perhaps concerns with how OSC compares and fits in with the UK Research Network but I think there is space for both as they have common goals but from different angles, with UKRN promoting training and disseminating best practices and understand what factors promote reproducibility and replicability. Communities compliment these efforts and should provide local support for when people come across problems that weren’t covered in training or are unique to a persons problem.\nFrom a personal perspective, whilst the University of Sheffield has been supportive of the idea of OSC Sheffield they haven’t afforded me any work time allocation to cover the time I spend on it so the tasks of coordinating SheffieldR and Reproducibilitea and so forth are an adjunct to my main duties and responsibilities, but as I said at the outset I’m passionate about open and reproducible research so I don’t mind."
